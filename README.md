In our signal and system course we had to process a audio. they gave us an audio file and we had to process it and first understand the voice and then do some actions on it. These actions were:
1) Revealing the original audio.
2) Making another audio with double speed of the original audio.
3) Making another audio with half speed of the original audio.
4) Making another audio which is reverse of the original audio.
hope it helps you.
